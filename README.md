# nantr0nic's python learning adventure repo

Just a collection of random python stuff I've been practicing/learning/developing.

Completed projects are in /finished/

Near future goals: pygame, web scraping, practicing various API's, and I like messing around with user interfaces (even though that seems uncommon).

I'm a noob and if you have suggestions (good books, projects to try, good pygame tutorials or projects, etc.) please let me know -- I appreciate you :)
