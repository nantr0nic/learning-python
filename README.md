## Python Learning Adventure!
This repo contains my python studies. It contains exercises files and code from Python books I worked through as well as projects I worked on independently of those books (e.g. PyGame, Web Scraping, etc.).

Notable things are in the "Finished" folder, including "Cirpal" and my "Nonsense Word Generator".

At the beginning of 2025 I switched to learning C++ (there's a repository for that!), but I plan to come back to Python at a later time.

Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any suggestions, comments, questions, or musings :)
