A non-sense word generator for decoding practice.

Generates non-sense words based on consonant and vowel sounds for flashcards.
Ex: CV, VC, CVC, CCVC, CCVCC, VCVCC.

Need to exclude CC's like "QZ", "XR", "KT", "MX".

Implementation:
Can either use text files with appropriate "CC" combinations or define inappropriate combinations
then exclude them from the random generator.
Or, alternatively, the improbables "QZ" and so on can remain and it can be left to the discretion
of the user whether or not to transfer them to flash cards.
    Reasoning: some (possibly more advanced) students may enjoy the challenge of the improbables.
