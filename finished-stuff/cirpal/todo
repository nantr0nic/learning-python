Use pygame to make a color palette maker thing.

Move the circle around, change its color, if you like the color the hit spacebar and it prints that circle in place.
If the circle is printed somehow the RGB is displayed to you or saved to file or you can export a picture of the window to file so libresprite can import palette from the image etc.

Some features:
- Mousewheel changes color randomly
- Spacebar prints circle
- Arrows (or WASD) move circle around
- L / R clicking keeps the hue but changes brightness/saturation up / down
