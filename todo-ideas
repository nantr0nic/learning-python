Project Ideas

1. Password Manager -- Started
    1.1 Password Generator
        1.1.1 strength tester
        1.1.2 ability to set options [X]
            1.1.2.1 Checkboxes work! Tk and QT too complicated for this purpose, other more suitable TUI require older python versions (whatever)
        1.1.3 using randomness (?)
            1.1.3.1 random module vs making own RNG from timestamp vs other ways to use randomness (Goal: learn about randomness)
    1.2 Encrypted storage of passwords locally via files etc 
        1.2.1 master key typed in
            1.2.1.1 Might be good practice (Goal: encrypting non-text files?)
        1.2.2 using a file as key -- ## too complicated ## Skip.
        1.2.3 what makes for good file encryption?
            1.2.3.1 Too complicated (for now)
    1.3 Ability to plug passwords in (probably last... don't do.)
        1.3.1 Too complicated (for now) 
    1.4 Usable, sexy AI...
        1.4.1 Not worth it for now.
    1.5 android...?
        1.5.1 In the future

2. Palette maker circle app thing -- Make branch of pygame
    2.1 Using mouse wheel or something to find colors
    2.2 I like using the circle on a black background to find colors, perhaps
        using spacebar to leave circles of colors you like, right clicking twice
        to remove, then once you're ready click 'export' -->
    2.3 export or use rgb coordinates

3. Word generator / language builder
    3.1 choose # of syllables
    3.2 syllables = consonant + vowels and sometimes consonant
    3.3 upon approving a word give it a meaning and record it
    3.4 make dictionary, be able to translate sentences to built language
